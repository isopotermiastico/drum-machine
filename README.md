A simple browser-based drum machine built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

This project is a step sequencer that allows users to create basic drum patterns by toggling pads in a grid. Each row represents a different drum sound, and each column represents a step in the sequence. When playback is active, the sequencer loops through the steps and plays the selected sounds.

The interface layout is built using Flexbox, and the pads are dynamically generated with JavaScript.
